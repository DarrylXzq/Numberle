# Numberle

`Numberle` is a mathematical equation guessing game where players must accurately guess a randomly generated equation within `six attempts`. Players input their `equation`, and the goal is to match the `target equation`. In the calculation, players can use `numbers (0-9)` and `arithmetic symbols (+ - * / =)`.

## Overview of Features

| Feature       | Description                                                      |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic Logic   | Implement core functions like equation validation, user input handling, and color feedback. |
| Multi-Version Interface | Offers graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface (CLI). |
| Architecture Design | GUI version follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and the CLI version reuses the model from the GUI version. |
| Testing and Documentation | Complete unit tests, documentation, and provide class diagrams with detailed comments. |

## Personal Contributions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand the functional and non-functional requirements of the documentation.
> 2. **Design Pattern**: Use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to complete the GUI and CLI versions.
> 3. **Class Diagram Design**: Draw class diagrams, including fields, functions, and relationships between classes, ensuring clear short-term and long-term planning.
> 4. **GUI Architecture Implementation**:
>    - Use the `Observable` classâ€™s `SetChanged()` and `notifyObservers()` methods to notify `NumberleView` for view updates.
>    - Use `NumberleController` to manage the interaction logic in the GUI.
> 5. **Pre- and Post-Condition Declarations**: Add preconditions and postconditions for all public methods in the `NumberleModel` class, using `assert` for condition checks.
> 6. **Equation Legality Verification**: Use regular expressions to verify the legality of equations.
> 7. **UI Construction**: Build the GUI using the Swing framework, with layout arranged using the Box layout.
> 8. **Multiple Entry Points**: Provide different entry points for running the GUI and CLI versions.
> 9. **Flag Settings**:
>    - Error Information Display: If set, it shows error messages when the equation is invalid.
>    - Display for Testing Purposes: If set, displays the target equation.
>    - Equation Selection Mode: If set, the equation is randomly selected; otherwise, a fixed equation is used.
> 10. **Unit Testing**: Use the JUnit testing tool to conduct unit tests on `INumberleModel` to verify expected outputs for various inputs.
